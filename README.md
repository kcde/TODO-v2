# TODO v2

This is my second iteration on the famous todo app.

My aim is to use this project to learn some technology and implemement ones i've learnt.

I plan on using react and chakra ui for the client side, redux for stage management(i know! it's an overkill) and firebase for server side

I want users to be able to create acounts and save their list. This would also be PWA.(fingers crossed)

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Chakra ui, Redux

**Server:** Firebase
